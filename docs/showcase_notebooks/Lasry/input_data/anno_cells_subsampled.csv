SAMPLE TYPE: Bone Marrow 
LABORATORY INTERPRETATION: 
Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrates an abnormal myeloid 
blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers

recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers 
analyzed. The monocytes show aberrant expression of CD56/CD16. ","x","x","x","","","",NA,NA,"0,3","0.0","0.0","0.0",0,0,"0","0,44",0,"0.0",0,0,0,0,"0,44",0,"0","0.05

SAMPLE TYPE: Bone Marrow 
LABORATORY INTERPRETATION: 
Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrates an abnormal myeloid 
blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers

blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers 
analyzed. The monocytes show aberrant expression of CD56/CD16. ","x","x","x","","","",NA,NA,"0,3","0.0","0.0","0.0",0,0,"0","0,44",0,"0.0",0,0,0,0,"0,44",0,"0","0.05

SAMPLE TYPE: Bone Marrow 
LABORATORY INTERPRETATION: 
Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrates an abnormal myeloid 
blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers

blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers 
analyzed. The monocytes show aberrant expression of CD56/CD16. ","x","x","x","","","",NA,NA,"0,3","0.0","0.0","0.0",0,0,"0","0,44",0,"0.0",0,0,0,0,"0,44",0,"0","0.05

SAMPLE TYPE: Bone Marrow 
LABORATORY INTERPRETATION: 
Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrates an abnormal myeloid 
blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers

blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers 
analyzed. The monocytes show aberrant expression of CD56/CD16. ","x","x","x","","","",NA,NA,"0,3","0.0","0.0","0.0",0,0,"0","0,44",0,"0.0",0,0,0,0,"0,44",0,"0","0.05

SAMPLE TYPE: Bone Marrow 
LABORATORY INTERPRETATION: 
Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrates an abnormal myeloid 
blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers

blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers 
analyzed. The monocytes show aberrant expression of CD56/CD16. ","x","x","x","","","",NA,NA,"0,3","0.0","0.0","0.0",0,0,"0","0,44",0,"0.0",0,0,0,0,"0,44",0,"0","0.05

SAMPLE TYPE: Bone Marrow 
LABORATORY INTERPRETATION: 
Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrates an abnormal myeloid 
blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers

blast population (approximately 8% of total events) with aberrant CD7 expression, consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Correlation with bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic studies is 
recommended. The B cells are unremarkable. The T cells have a mildly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with no significant loss of T cell antigens as can be seen in reactive T cells. 
PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTION: Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow was performed using a ten color technique with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter characteristics. Lymphocytes represent 22.6 % of the total events analyzed. Of the lymphocytes: 11.1 % are B cells (CD19+) with a Kappa:Lambda ratio of 8:5 , 81.6 % are T cells (CD3+) with a 
CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.7 and 6.6 % are NK cells (positive for CD56 and/or CD16 and negative for CD3). Blasts, defined by CD45 faint staining and low side scatter represent 7.8 % of the total events 
analyzed and express CD117+, CD13+, HLA DR+, CD7+, CD33+, MPO+ with subpopulatios sexpressing CD4+ (20%), CD34+ (24%), CD65+ (32%) and are negative for the remaining markers 
analyzed. The monocytes show aberrant expression of CD56/CD16. ","x","x","x","","","",NA,NA,"0,3","0.0","0.0","0.0",0,0,"0","0,44",0,"0.0",0,0,0,0,"0,44",0,"0","0.05
